# Please note!

The project uses [the Speechly UE4 plug-in](https://github.com/speechly/ue4plugin) which is **out-dated**. However, you may use this as extra documentation for those interested in Unreal integration. To get this up and running, the very least one should do is to [update the gRPC protos](https://github.com/speechly/api/tree/master/cpp).

## Getting started

Requires Speechly plugin in the plugins folder.

Run git submodule init && git submodule update to fetch it.
